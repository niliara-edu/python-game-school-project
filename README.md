# Hi!

This is a school project heavily "inspired" by Slayin',
made using python3 and the pyxel fantasy console.
Heavily under development.

## Dependencies

To play the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed in your system:
- [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)
- [Sqlite](https://sqlite.org/)

If you want to contribute, please feel free to point every single mistake I do!
I'm pretty bad at coding and feedback would be extremely appreciated!

Documentation will be uploaded soon!
